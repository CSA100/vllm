Now, please provide the skeleton for the following question. Do not provide anything else but the skeleton. [Question]Here is a piece of C++ code that shows some very peculiar behavior.\n\nFor some reason, sorting the data (before the timed region) miraculously makes the primary loop almost six times faster:\n\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <ctime>\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main()\n{\n    // Generate data\n    const unsigned arraySize = 32768;\n    int data[arraySize];\n\n    for (unsigned c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)\n        data[c] = std::rand() % 256;\n\n    // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster.\n    std::sort(data, data + arraySize);\n\n    // Test\n    clock_t start = clock();\n    long long sum = 0;\n    for (unsigned i = 0; i < 100000; ++i)\n    {\n        for (unsigned c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)\n        {   // Primary loop.\n            if (data[c] >= 128)\n                sum += data[c];\n        }\n    }\n\n    double elapsedTime = static_cast<double>(clock()-start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;\n\n    std::cout << elapsedTime << '\\n';\n    std::cout << \"sum = \" << sum << '\\n';\n}\nWithout std::sort(data, data + arraySize);, the code runs in 11.54 seconds.\nWith the sorted data, the code runs in 1.93 seconds.\n(Sorting itself takes more time than this one pass over the array, so it's not actually worth doing if we needed to calculate this for an unknown array.)\n\nInitially, I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly, so I tried Java:\n\nimport java.util.Arrays;\nimport java.util.Random;\n\npublic class Main\n{\n    public static void main(String[] args)\n    {\n        // Generate data\n        int arraySize = 32768;\n        int data[] = new int[arraySize];\n\n        Random rnd = new Random(0);\n        for (int c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)\n            data[c] = rnd.nextInt() % 256;\n\n        // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster\n        Arrays.sort(data);\n\n        // Test\n        long start = System.nanoTime();\n        long sum = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < 100000; ++i)\n        {\n            for (int c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)\n            {   // Primary loop.\n                if (data[c] >= 128)\n                    sum += data[c];\n            }\n        }\n\n        System.out.println((System.nanoTime() - start) / 1000000000.0);\n        System.out.println(\"sum = \" + sum);\n    }\n}\nWith a similar but less extreme result.\n\nMy first thought was that sorting brings the data into the cache, but that's silly because the array was just generated.\n\nWhat is going on?\nWhy is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?[End of question] Skeleton:", "response": "\n\n1. Sorting the data speeds up the primary loop.\n2. The primary loop processes the array in the sorted order.\n3. The sorted order reduces the number of comparisons in the primary loop.\n4. The reduced number of comparisons leads to faster execution.\n5. The observed speedup is likely due to cache locality."}
