{"prompt": "This paper proposes a novel neural network for explainable fake news detection based on raw reports from different media outlets. The proposed model consists of a hierarchical encoder for web text representation, and two cascaded selectors to select the most explainable sentences for verdicts. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art detection baselines and generates high-quality explanations from diverse evaluation perspectives. The paper also presents two explainable fake news datasets, which are publicly available.\n\n1. Could the authors provide more detailed information on the implementation process of the proposed method?\n2. Could the authors conduct more extensive evaluation and ablation studies to support the proposed method's performance?\n3. Could the authors compare the proposed method with more widely-known baselines in the field?", "key_tokens": "\n\n1. Implementation details\n2. Evaluation and ablation studies\n3.
